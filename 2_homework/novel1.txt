legists, that the first pyramids were founded for astro- 
nomical purposes : a theory singularly supported by the 
peculiar stair-like formation of all four sides of those 
edifices ; whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of their 
legs, those old astronomers were wont to mount to the 
apex, and sing out for new stars ; even as the look-outs 
of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just bearing 
in sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit 
of old times, who built him a lofty stone pillar in the 
desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on its 
summit, hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle ; 
in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless 
stander of mast-heads ; who was not to be driven from 
his place by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet ; but vali- 
antly facing everything out to the last, literally died at 
his post. Of modern standers of mast-heads we have 
but a lifeless set ; mere stone, iron, and bronze men ; who, 
though well capable of facing out a stiff gale, are still 
entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon 
discovering any strange sight. There is Napoleon ; who, 
upon the top of the column of Vendome, stands with arms 
folded, some one hundred and fifty feet in the air ; care- 
less, now, who rules the decks below ; whether Louis- 
Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great 
Washington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main- 
mast in Baltimore, and like one of Hercules' pillars, his 
column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which 
few mortals will go. Admiral Nelson, also, on a capstan 
of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in Trafalgar Square ; 
and ever when most obscured by that London smoke, 
token is yet given that a hidden hero is there ; for where 
there is smoke, must be fire. But neither great Washing- 
ton, nor Napoleon, nor Nelson, will answer a single hail 
from below, however madly invoked to befriend by their 
counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze ;
